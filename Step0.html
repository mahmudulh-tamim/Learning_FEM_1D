<h1>Step-0</h1>

<p>In <a href="./Learning_FEM_1D_step0.ipynb">the Step-0 Jupyter Notebook</a>, I provide a basic introduction.</p>

<p>We solve the following diffusion + reaction equation, with a source term:</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?-\\frac{d}{dx}D\\frac{du}{dx}&space;+&space;\\sigma&space;u&space;=&space;q&space;\\qquad&space;\\forall&space;x&space;\\in&space;[0,L]" alt="Equation" />
</p>

<p>We will assume all material properties D, Ïƒ, q to be constant for now.</p>

<p>We use the following boundary conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>at x=0, we impose a value u(0) = u<sub>left</sub></li>
  <li>at x=L, we impose a value u(L) = u<sub>right</sub></li>
</ul>

<p>These conditions are known as Dirichlet boundary conditions.</p>

<h2>Meshing the domain</h2>
<p>
  The interval [0, L] is meshed using N cells. In FEM, mesh cells are known as 'elements'. The vertices of the mesh are denoted by x<sub>i</sub> and there are N+1 vertices. Obviously, x<sub>0</sub> = 0 and x<sub>N</sub> = L.
</p>

<h2>Choice of solution space</h2>
<p>
  We will approximate the solution to the above problem as a <strong>piece-wise linear</strong> function. Between two consecutive vertices, the function is linear, as shown in the plot below.
</p>

<p>Many FEM concepts such as the assembly of the global matrix per element, the reference element, ... are not discussed at first.</p>

<p>At the end of the <a href="./Learning_FEM_1D_step0.ipynb">Step-0</a> Jupyter Notebook, I do the global assembly by looping over elements.</p>
